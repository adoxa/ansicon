    ===========
    Description
    ===========

    ANSICON provides ANSI escape sequences for Windows console programs.  It
    provides much the same functionality as `ANSI.SYS' does for MS-DOS.


    ============
    Requirements
    ============

    32-bit: Windows 2000 Professional and later (it won't work with NT or 9X).
    64-bit: Vista and later (it won't work with XP64).


    ============
    Installation
    ============

    Download from http://adoxa.3eeweb.com/ansicon/

    Add x86 (if your OS is 32-bit) or x64 (if 64-bit) to your PATH, or copy
    the relevant files to a directory already on the PATH.  Alternatively,
    use option `-i' (or `-I') to install it permanently, by adding an entry
    to CMD.EXE's AutoRun registry value (current user or local machine,
    respectively).  Uninstall simply involves closing any programs that are
    currently using it, running with `-u' (and/or `-U') to remove the Auto-
    Run entry/ies, then removing the directory from PATH or deleting the
    files.  No other changes are made.

    ---------
    Upgrading
    ---------

    Delete ANSI.dll, it has been replaced with ANSI32.dll.
    Delete ANSI-LLA.exe, it has been replaced with ANSI-LLW.exe.
    Uninstall a pre-1.50 version and reinstall with this version.


    =====
    Usage
    =====

    Options (case sensitive):

	-l	Log to %temp%\ansicon.log.

	-p	Enable the parent process (i.e. the command shell used to
		run ANSICON) to recognise escapes.

	-m	Set the current (and default) attribute to grey on black
		("monochrome"), or the attribute following the `m' (please
		use `COLOR /?' for attribute values).

	-e	Echo the command line - a space or tab after the `e' is
		ignored, the remainder is displayed verbatim.

	-E	As above, but no newline is added.

	-t	Display ("type") each file (or standard input if none or the
		name is "-") as though they are a single file.

	-T	Display "==> FILE NAME <==", a blank line (or an error
		message), the file and another blank line.

    Running ANSICON with no arguments will start a new instance of the com-
    mand processor (the program defined by the `ComSpec' environment var-
    iable, typically `CMD.EXE'), or display standard input if it is redir-
    ected.  Any argument will be treated as a program and its arguments.
    
    Eg: `ansicon -m30 -t file.ans' will display `file.ans' using black on
    cyan as the default color.

    The attribute may start with "-" to permanently reverse the foreground
    and background colors (but not when using `-p').  Eg: `ansicon -m-f0 -t
    file.log' will use reversed black on white as the default (i.e. white on
    black, with foreground sequences changing the background).

    If you experience trouble with certain programs, the log may help in
    finding the cause; it  can be found at "%TEMP%\ansicon.log".  A number
    should follow the `l':

	0	No logging
	1	Log process start and end
	2	Above, plus log modules used by the process
	3	Above, plus log functions that are hooked
	4	Log console output (add to any of the above)
	8	Append to the existing file (add to any of the above)
       16	Log all imported modules (add to any of the above)

    The log option will not work with `-p'; set the environment variable
    ANSICON_LOG instead.  The variable is only read once when a new process
    is started; changing it won't affect running processes.  If you identify
    a module that causes problems, add it to the ANSICON_EXC environment
    variable (see ANSICON_API below, but the extension is required).

    Once installed, the ANSICON environment variable will be created.  This
    variable is of the form "WxH (wxh)", where W & H are the width and
    height of the buffer and w & h are the width and height of the window.
    The variable is updated whenever a program reads it directly (i.e. as
    an individual request, not as part of the entire environment block).
    For example, "set an" will not update it, but "echo %ansicon%" will.
    Also created is ANSICON_VER, which contains the version without the
    point (1.50 becomes "150").  This variable does not exist as part of the
    environment block ("set an" will not show it).

    If installed, GUI programs will not be hooked.  Either start the program
    directly with `ansicon', or add it to the ANSICON_GUI variable (see
    ANSICON_API below).

    Using `ansicon' after install will always start with the default attrib-
    utes, restoring the originals on exit; all other programs will use the
    current attributes.  The shift state is always reset for a new process.

    The Windows API WriteFile and WriteConsoleA functions will set the num-
    ber of characters written, not the number of bytes.  When using a multi-
    byte character set, this results in a smaller number (since multiple
    bytes are used to represent a single character).  Some programs recog-
    nise this as a reduced write and will inadvertently repeat previous
    characters.  If you discover such a program, use the ANSICON_API envir-
    onment variable to record it and override the API, returning the origin-
    al byte count.  Ruby is an example of such a program (at least, up till
    1.9.2p0), so use "set ANSICON_API=ruby" to avoid the repitition.  The
    full syntax of the variable is:

	ANSICON_API=[!]program;program;program...

    PROGRAM is the name of the program, with no path and extension.  The
    leading exclamation inverts the usage, meaning the API will always be
    overridden, unless the program is in the list.  The variable can be made
    permanent by going to System Properties, selecting the Advanced tab and
    clicking Environment Variables (using XP; Vista/7 may be different).


    ====================
    Sequences Recognised
    ====================

    The following escape sequences are recognised.

	\e]0;titleBEL		Set (xterm) window's title (and icon)
	\e[21t			Report (xterm) window's title
	\e[s			Save Cursor
	\e[u			Restore Cursor
	\e[#G		CHA	Cursor Character Absolute
	\e[#E		CNL	Cursor Next Line
	\e[#F		CPL	Cursor Preceding Line
	\e[#D		CUB	Cursor Left
	\e[#B		CUD	Cursor Down
	\e[#C		CUF	Cursor Right
	\e[#;#H 	CUP	Cursor Position
	\e[#A		CUU	Cursor Up
	\e[#P		DCH	Delete Character
	\e[?25h 	DECTCEM DEC Text Cursor Enable Mode (show cursor)
	\e[?25l 	DECTCEM DEC Text Cursor Enable Mode (hide cursor)
	\e[#M		DL	Delete Line
	\e[#n		DSR	Device Status Report
	\e[#X		ECH	Erase Character
	\e[#J		ED	Erase In Page
	\e[#K		EL	Erase In Line
	\e[#`		HPA	Character Position Absolute
	\e[#j		HPB	Character Position Backward
	\e[#a		HPR	Character Position Forward
	\e[#;#f 	HVP	Character And Line Position
	\e[#@		ICH	Insert Character
	\e[#L		IL	Insert Line
	SI		LS0	Locking-shift Zero (see below)
	SO		LS1	Locking-shift One
	\e[#;#;#m	SGR	Select Graphic Rendition
	\e[#d		VPA	Line Position Absolute
	\e[#k		VPB	Line Position Backward
	\e[#e		VPR	Line Position Forward

    `\e' represents the escape character (ASCII 27); `#' represents a
    decimal number (optional, in most cases defaulting to 1); BEL, SO and
    SI are ASCII 7, 14 and 15.	Regarding SGR: bold will set the foreground
    intensity; underline and blink will set the background intensity;
    conceal uses background as foreground.  See `sequences.txt' for a more
    complete description.

    I make a distinction between "\e[m" and "\e[0;...m".  Both will restore
    the original foreground/background colors (and so "0" should be the
    first parameter); the former will also restore the original bold and
    underline attributes, whilst the latter will explicitly reset them.  The
    environment variable ANSICON_DEF can be used to change the default col-
    ors (same value as `-m'; setting the variable does not change the cur-
    rent colors).


    =================
    Sequences Ignored
    =================

    The following escape sequences are explicitly ignored.

	\e(?		Designate G0 character set (`?' is anything).
	\e)?		Designate G1 character set (`?' is anything).
	\e[?... 	Private sequence
	\e[>... 	Private sequence

    The G0 character set is always ASCII; the G1 character set is always
    the DEC Special Graphics Character Set.


    ==================================
    DEC Special Graphics Character Set
    ==================================

    This is my interpretation of the set, as shown by
    http://vt100.net/docs/vt220-rm/table2-4.html.

    G1.txt is a Unicode file to view the glyphs "externally".  G1.bat is a
    batch file (using `x86\ansicon') to show the glyphs in the console.  The
    characters will appear as they should using Lucida (other than the Sym-
    bols), but code page will influence them when using a raster font (but
    of particular interest, 437 and 850 both show the Box Drawings).


    ===========
    Limitations
    ===========

    The entire console buffer is used, not just the visible window.

    Building rubyinstaller on Win7 crashes (XP is fine).

    There's a conflict with NVIDIA's 64-bit drivers, requiring the setting
    of the Environment Variable:

	ANSICON_EXC=nvd3d9wrap.dll,nvd3d9wrapx.dll


    ===============
    Version History
    ===============

    Legend: + added, - bug-fixed, * changed.

    1.61 - 14 February, 2013:
    * revert back to using ANSI-LLW.exe, as the new method was unreliable.

    1.60 - 24 November, 2012:
    * new method to get the 32-bit LoadLibraryW address from 64-bit code.
      This removes the need for ANSI-LLW.exe, which caused lots of virus
      warnings, for some reason.
    - set the code page to display some file names properly;
    + expand wildcards for -t (ignoring directories and hidden/binary files).

    1.53 - 12 June, 2012:
    - fix for multiple simultaneous process creation (e.g. "cl /MP ...").

    1.52 - 2 June, 2012:
    + 32-bit processes can inject into 64-bit processes;
    + implemented \e[39m & \e[49m (set default foreground/background color);
    + added \e[#X, \e[#`, \e[#a, \e[#d, \e[#e, \[e#j and \e[#k;
    * changed sequence descriptions to those in ECMA-48, ordered by acronym.

    1.51 - 24 February, 2012:
    - fixed installing into a piped/redirected CMD.EXE;
    - fixed 32-bit process trying to identify a 64-bit process;
    - ignore version within core API DLL names (now Win8 works);
    + hook _lwrite & _hwrite (now Silverfrost FTN95 v6.20 works).

    1.50 - 14 December, 2011:
    - -u does not imply -p;
    - return the program's exit code;
    - -p by itself will not restore original color;
    - output error messages to stderr;
    * logging is always available, with various levels; include the pid;
    * don't automatically hook GUI programs, use `ansicon' or ANSICON_GUI;
    * always place first in AutoRun; don't run if already installed;
    + global reverse video capability;
    + added ANSICON_VER to provide version/install test;
    + added ANSICON_EXC to exclude selected modules;
    + added ANSICON_DEF to explicitly set the default SGM.

    1.40 - 1 March, 2011:
    - hook GetProcAddress (now PowerShell works);
    + add SO/SI, using the DEC Special Graphics Character Set for G1;
    + add DECTCEM to show/hide the cursor.

    1.32 - 22 December, 2010:
    - fixed crash due to NULL lpNumberOfBytesWritten/lpNumberOfCharsWritten;
    - -p will test the parent process for validity;
    * hook into GUI processes;
    + recognise DSR and xterm window title sequences;
    - fixed MinGW32 binaries (LLW was wrong).

    1.31 - 19 November, 2010:
    - fixed multibyte support (no extra junk with UTF-8 files);
    * provide workaround for API byte/character differences;
    * fixed potential problem if install path uses Unicode.

    1.30 - 7 September, 2010:
    + x64 version.

    1.25 - 22 July, 2010:
    - hook LoadLibraryEx (now CScript works);
    - fixed -i when AutoRun existed, but was empty;
    + support for Windows 7;
    + -I (and -U) use HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

    1.24 - 7 January, 2010:
    - fix -t and -e when ANSICON was already running;
    + read standard input if redirected with no arguments, if -t has no
      files, or if the name is "-" (which also serves as a workaround for
      programs that don't get hooked, such as CScript).

    1.23 - 11 November, 2009:
    - restore hooked functions when unloading;
    - reverse the "bold" and "underline" settings;
    * conceal characters by making foreground color same as background.

    * use a new injection method (to work with DEP);
    * use Unicode.

    1.12 - 9 March, 2009:
    - fix processing child programs (generate a relocatable DLL).

    1.11 - 28 February, 2009:
    - fix processing child programs (only use for console executables).

    1.10 - 22 February, 2009:
    - fix output corruption (buffer overflow in MyConsoleWriteW);
    - recognise current screen attributes as current ANSI atrributes;
    - ignore Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Break;

    The original zipfile can be freely distributed, by any means.  However,
    I would like to be informed if it is placed on a CD-ROM (other than an
    archive compilation; permission is granted, I'd just like to know).
    Modified versions may be distributed, provided it is indicated as such
    in the version text and a source diff is made available.  In particular,
    the supplied binaries are freely redistributable, but the x64 binaries
    must also include COPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt.  A formal license (zlib)
    is available in LICENSE.txt.
