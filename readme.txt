Description
===========

    ANSICON provides ANSI escape sequences for Windows console programs.  It
    provides much the same functionality as 'ANSI.SYS' does for MS-DOS.


Requirements
============

    32-bit: Windows 2000 Professional and later (it won't work with NT or 9X).
    64-bit: AMD64 (IA64 could work with a little modification).


Installation
============

    * Download the ANSICON zip file (including the executables) from the
      Releases page (https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon/releases) or 
      http://ansicon.adoxa.vze.com/

    * Unzip the files into a directory such as C:\Program Files\ansicon\

Launching
---------

    There are different ways to launch, depending on your usage.

    * Manual launch: 1) Open the Command Prompt, 2) change to the program's
      directory that was created in the steps above.
    
        "cd \Program Files\ansicon\x86" (for 32-bit OS)
        "cd \Program Files\ansicon\x64" (for 64-bit OS)

      3) Type 'ansicon' to launch the upgraded command prompt.
    
    * Manual launch from anywhere in the system: Edit your PATH environment
      variable to include the location of the program file. Open System 
      Properties (Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced
      system settings) and open the "Advanced" tab. Click the "Environment
      Variables..." button and edit the Path variable. Add one of the paths
      below to the end of the PATH value:

        ";\Program Files\ansicon\x86;" (for 32-bit OS)
        ";\Program Files\ansicon\x64;" (for 64-bit OS)

    * Automatic Launch: Use option '-i' (or '-I', if permitted) to add an
      entry to CMD.EXE's AutoRun registry value (current user or local
      machine, respectively). This means "Command Prompt" and any program
      started by CMD.EXE will automatically have sequences.

    * Automatic Launch: Add "d:\path\to\ansicon.exe -p" to your Startup
      group (run minimized to avoid the console window flashing).  This
      means any console program started by Explorer will automatically
      have sequences.

    Uninstall involves closing any programs that are currently using it; using
    the Run dialog to run "d:\path\to\ansicon.exe -pu" to remove it from
    Explorer; running with '-u' (and/or '-U') to remove it from AutoRun; remov-
    ing the directory from PATH; and deleting the files.  No other changes are
    made (unless you created environment variables).

Upgrading
---------

    Delete ANSICON_API - it has switched from WriteFile to WriteConsoleA.


Usage
=====

    Options (case sensitive):

	-l	Log to "%TEMP%\ansicon.log".

	-p	Enable the parent process (i.e. the command shell used to run
		ANSICON) to recognise escapes.

	-pu	Unload from the parent process, restoring it.

	-m	Set the current (and default) attribute to grey on black
		("monochrome"), or the attribute following the 'm' (please
		use 'COLOR /?' for attribute values).

	-e	Echo the command line - a space or tab after the 'e' is
		ignored, the remainder is displayed verbatim.

	-E	As above, but no newline is added.

	-t	Display ("type") each file (or standard input if none or the
		name is "-") as though they are a single file.

	-T	Display "==> FILE NAME <==", a blank line (or an error
		message), the file and another blank line.

    Running ANSICON with no arguments will start a new instance of the command
    processor (the program defined by the 'ComSpec' environment variable, typ-
    ically 'CMD.EXE'), or display standard input if it is redirected.  Any arg-
    ument will be treated as a program and its arguments.
    
    E.g.: 'ansicon -m30 -t file.ans' will display "file.ans" using black on
    cyan as the default color.

    The attribute may start with '-' to permanently reverse the foreground and
    background colors (but not when using '-p').  E.g.: 'ansicon -m-f0 -t
    file.log' will use reversed black on white as the default (i.e. white on
    black, with foreground sequences changing the background).

    If you experience trouble with certain programs, the log may help in find-
    ing the cause; it can be found at "%TEMP%\ansicon.log".  A number should
    immediately follow the 'l':

	0	No logging
	1	Log process start and end
	2	Above, plus log modules used by the process
	3	Above, plus log functions that are hooked
	4	Log console output (add to any of the above)
	8	Append to the existing file (add to any of the above)
       16	Log all imported modules (add to any of the above)
       32	Log CreateFile (add to any of the above)

    The log option will not work with '-p'; set the environment variable
    ANSICON_LOG (to the number) instead.  The variable is only read once when a
    process is started; changing it won't affect running processes.  If you
    identify a program or module that causes problems, add it to the
    ANSICON_EXC environment variable (see ANSICON_API below; add the extension
    to exclude a single module).  Be aware that excluding a program will also
    exclude any programs it creates (alghough excluding "program.exe" may still
    hook created programs run through its DLLs).

    E.g.: 'ansicon -l5' will start a new command processor, logging every pro-
    cess it starts along with their output.

    Once installed, the ANSICON environment variable will be created.  This
    variable is of the form "WxH (wxh)", where 'W' & 'H' are the width and
    height of the buffer and 'w' & 'h' are the width and height of the window.
    The variable is updated whenever a program reads it directly (i.e. as an
    individual request, not as part of the entire environment block).  For
    example, 'set an' will not update it, but 'echo %ansicon%' will.  Also
    created are ANSICON_VER, which contains the version without the point (1.80
    becomes "180"), and CLICOLOR (see http://bixense.com/clicolors/), which
    contains "1".  These variables do not exist as part of the environment
    block (e.g. 'set an' will not show ANSICON_VER).

    If installed, GUI programs will not be hooked.  Either start the program
    directly with 'ansicon', or add it to the ANSICON_GUI variable (see
    ANSICON_API below).

    Using 'ansicon' after install will always start with the default attrib-
    utes, restoring the originals on exit; all other programs will use the cur-
    rent attributes.  The shift state and insert mode are always reset for a
    new process.

    ANSICON will detect when a line wraps at the right margin and suppress a
    following newline.	Some programs detect the wrap themselves and so the
    following newline is actually for a blank line; use the ANSICON_WRAP
    variable to indicate as such (see ANSICON_API below).

    My version of WriteConsoleA will always set the number of characters writt-
    en, not the number of bytes.  This means writing a double-byte character as
    two bytes will set 0 the first write (nothing was written) and 1 the second
    (when the character was actually written); Windows normally sets 1 for both
    writes.  Similarly, writing the individual bytes of a multibyte character
    will set 0 for all but the last byte, then 1 on the last; Windows normally
    sets 1 for each byte, writing the undefined character.  However, my
    WriteFile (and _lwrite/_hwrite) will always set what was received; Windows,
    using a multibyte character set (but not DBCS), would set the characters.
    You can have WriteConsoleA return the original byte count by using the
    ANSICON_API environment variable:

	ANSICON_API=[!]program;program;program...

    PROGRAM is the name of the program, with no path and extension.  The lead-
    ing exclamation inverts the usage, meaning the API will always be over-
    ridden, unless the program is in the list.	The variable can be made perm-
    anent by going to System Properties, selecting the Advanced tab (with Vista
    onwards, this can be done by running "SystemPropertiesAdvanced") and click-
    ing Environment Variables.

    '\e' represents the escape character (ASCII 27); '#' represents a decimal
    number (optional, in most cases defaulting to 1); BEL, HT, SO and SI are
    ASCII 7, 9, 14 and 15.

    Escape followed by a control character will display that character, not
    perform its function; an unrecognised character will preserve the escape.

    SO will select the G1 character set; SI will select the G0 set.  The G0
    character set is set by SCS; the G1 character set is always the DEC Special
    Graphics Character Set.

    I make a distinction between '\e[m' and '\e[0;...m'.  Both will restore the
    original foreground/background colors (and so '0' should be the first para-
    meter); the former will also restore the original bold and underline attri-
    butes, whilst the latter will explicitly reset them.  The environment var-
    iable ANSICON_DEF can be used to change the default colors (same value as
    '-m'; setting the variable does not change the current colors).

    The first time a program clears the screen ('\e[2J') will actually scroll
    in a new window (assuming the buffer is bigger than the window, of course).
    Subsequent clears will then blank the window.  However, if the window has
    scrolled, or the cursor is on the last line of the buffer, it will again
    scroll in a new window.


DEC Special Graphics Character Set
==================================

    This is my interpretation of the set, as shown by
    http://vt100.net/docs/vt220-rm/table2-4.html.

    G1.txt is a Unicode file to view the glyphs "externally".  G1.bat is a
    batch file (using 'x86\ansicon') to show the glyphs in the console.  The
    characters will appear as they should using Lucida (other than the Sym-
    bols), but code page will influence them when using a raster font (but of
    particular interest, 437 and 850 both show the Box Drawings).


Limitations
===========

    Tabs can only be set up to column 2048.
    The saved position will not be restored correctly if the buffer scrolls.
    Palette sequences only work from Vista.

    There may be a conflict with NVIDIA's drivers, requiring the setting of the
    Environment Variable:

	ANSICON_EXC=nvd3d9wrap.dll;nvd3d9wrapx.dll

    An application using multiple screen buffers will not have separate
    attributes in each buffer.

    Console input that is echoed will not be processed (which is probably a
    good thing for escapes, but not so good for margins).


Version History
===============

    * limit parameters to a maximum value of 32767;
    * go back to saving the buffer cursor position;
    * preserve escape that isn't part of a sequence;

    - handle STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE & STD_ERROR_HANDLE in WriteFile;
    - better handling of unusual PE files;
    * cache GetConsoleMode for an improvement in speed;
    * files writing to the console always succeed (should mostly remove the
      need for ANSICON_API);
    * log: add a blank line between processes;
	   remove the separate line for WriteFile & _lwrite;
	   write byte strings as-is, wide strings using the current code page;
	   use caret notation for control characters, with hexadecimal "^xNN"
	    and "^uNNNN" for characters not in the code page (custom printf);
    * join multibyte characters split across separate writes;
    * remove wcstok, avoiding potential interference with the host program;

	   add an underscore in 64-bit addresses to distinguish 8-digit groups;
    * ANSICON_EXC can exclude entire programs;
    * switch G1 blank from space (U+0020) to No-Break Space (U+00A0);
    * use window height, not buffer;
    * remove newline after wrap;
    + recognise more sequences.

    * add the architecture (32- or 64-bit) to the log.

    1.61 - 14 February, 2013:
    * revert back to using ANSI-LLW.exe, as the new method was unreliable.

    1.60 - 24 November, 2012:
    * new method to get the 32-bit LoadLibraryW address from 64-bit code.
      This removes the need for ANSI-LLW.exe, which caused lots of virus
      warnings, for some reason.
    - set the code page to display some file names properly;
    + expand wildcards for -t (ignoring directories and hidden/binary files).

    1.53 - 12 June, 2012:
    - fix for multiple simultaneous process creation (e.g. "cl /MP ...").

    1.52 - 2 June, 2012:
    + 32-bit processes can inject into 64-bit processes;
    + implemented \e[39m & \e[49m (set default foreground/background color);

    + hook _lwrite & _hwrite (now Silverfrost FTN95 v6.20 works).

    1.50 - 14 December, 2011:
    - -u does not imply -p;
    - return the program's exit code;
    - -p by itself will not restore original color;
    - output error messages to stderr;
    * logging is always available, with various levels; include the pid;
    * don't automatically hook GUI programs, use 'ansicon' or ANSICON_GUI;
    * always place first in AutoRun; don't run if already installed;
    + global reverse video capability;
    + added ANSICON_VER to provide version/install test;
    + added ANSICON_EXC to exclude selected modules;
    + added ANSICON_DEF to explicitly set the default SGM.
